        <h1>A.PONNARASAN</h1>
      
        <p>  Hi, I’m A.PONNARASAN, a passionate computer
        science student aspiring to work in IT. I 
        love learning new technologies and building
        creative projects</p> 
      
     <h1>ABOUT</h1>      
     <div> 
     I’m, a Computer Science Engineering student with 
     a deep curiosity for technology and how it shapes the world around us.
     I love coding, exploring new tools, and working on projects that 
     challenge me to think creatively and solve problems. My interests
     span across software development, web design, and emerging fields like
     AI and cloud computing.
    I believe learning is a continuous journey, 
    and I’m always excited to pick up new skills, 
    experiment with ideas, and bring them to life 
    through code. Beyond academics, I enjoy collaborating 
    with others, sharing knowledge, and contributing to 
    projects that make a positive impact.
